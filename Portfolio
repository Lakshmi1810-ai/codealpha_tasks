This task is about building a Stock Portfolio Tracker using Python. Based on the image, here's how you can implement it step-by-step:

âœ… TASK 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker
ðŸ“Œ Goal:
Build a simple stock tracker that:

Accepts user input (stock names and quantities).

Uses hardcoded stock prices in a dictionary.

Calculates and displays total investment value.

Optionally saves output to .txt or .csv.

ðŸ”§ Code Example:
python
Copy
Edit
# Hardcoded stock prices
stock_prices = {
    "AAPL": 180,
    "TSLA": 250,
    "GOOG": 2700,
    "MSFT": 330
}

# Dictionary to hold user portfolio
portfolio = {}

print("Enter stock name and quantity (type 'done' to finish):")
while True:
    stock = input("Stock symbol: ").upper()
    if stock == 'DONE':
        break
    if stock not in stock_prices:
        print("Stock not found in price list.")
        continue
    quantity = int(input("Quantity: "))
    portfolio[stock] = quantity

# Calculate total investment
total = 0
for stock, quantity in portfolio.items():
    price = stock_prices[stock]
    investment = price * quantity
    print(f"{stock}: {quantity} shares Ã— ${price} = ${investment}")
    total += investment

print(f"\nTotal Investment Value: ${total}")

# Optional: Save to file
save = input("Do you want to save this to a file? (yes/no): ").lower()
if save == "yes":
    with open("portfolio.txt", "w") as file:
        for stock, quantity in portfolio.items():
            price = stock_prices[stock]
            investment = price * quantity
            file.write(f"{stock}: {quantity} shares Ã— ${price} = ${investment}\n")
        file.write(f"\nTotal Investment Value: ${total}")
    print("Portfolio saved to 'portfolio.txt'")
